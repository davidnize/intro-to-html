HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 

Introduction

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the backbone of web development. HTML is a fundamental technology that structures content on the World Wide Web. This document provides an introduction to HTML, its purpose, and the basics of creating structured web pages.

Overview

HTML, an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It serves as the building block for web development, defining the elements and structure of a document. HTML works in tandem with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.

Purpose

The primary purpose of HTML is to structure content on the web. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML enables developers to organize information in a hierarchical and meaningful way, ensuring accessibility and compatibility across different devices and browsers.


Basic HTML Structure

HTML documents follow a basic structure with essential elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Defines the document type and version.
<html>: Root element of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata such as character set and viewport settings.
<title>: Sets the title of the web page displayed in the browser.
<body>: Contains the content of the web page.
Various tags like <h1>, <p>, <img>, and <a> represent different elements.
